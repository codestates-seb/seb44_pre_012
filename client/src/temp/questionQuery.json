However, as maintainer of Parcel, an alternative to Vite, I would appreciate if React did not play favorites (also with Next.js vs other frameworks). Since CRA was maintained by the React team it kinda made sense, but harder when it's not. Maybe a small description of each option with more details about what it's best for and the tradeoffs vs other options would be good?<br /><br /><b>if you're building an SPA, <u>Vite and Parcel</u> are good options</b>. Vite is a bundle-less dev server that works with React and other frameworks ...
